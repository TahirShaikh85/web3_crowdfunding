## Technologies Used
- React: Front-end user interface
- Thirdweb: Thirdweb SDK is a complete web 3.0 development framework that simplifies web 3.0 complexity and allows web developers to build web 3.0 applications that can interact with smart contracts using their preferred programming languages and frameworks.
- Solidity: Smart contract development
- Blockchain (Ethereum): Decentralized data storage and execution

### Usage
- Create a campaign with a funding goal, deadline, and other details.
- Contribute to existing campaigns by sending Ether.
- Track campaign progress and view the list of contributors.
- Withdraw funds when the campaign goal is met.

## Smart Contracts
The smart contracts used in this project are written in Solidity and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. You can find the contract code in the "contracts/" directory.
